# HW3 - Automated Testing & Javadoc Documentation

## 📚 Overview

This project is the third homework assignment for **CSE 360: Software Engineering** at Arizona State University. The goal of HW3 is to practice writing automated tests, become familiar with Javadoc documentation, and optionally begin exploring JUnit.

Each student is responsible for implementing and documenting five automated tests based on the team’s TP2 submission, as well as producing professional-level internal documentation and screencasts that showcase the tests and their results.

## 🧪 Assigned Test Cases

This repository includes the five automated test cases assigned to me from my team’s TP2 submission. Each test has been implemented in a standalone mainline format and is designed to validate specific functionalities using consistent validation logic.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Java 17+**
- **Manual Test Mainlines (JUnit optional)**
- **Javadoc**
- **Screencast (Voice-over with code walkthrough)**

## 📌 Professional Javadoc Inspiration

I modeled my Javadoc formatting after the official Java documentation for [`PriorityBlockingQueue`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/concurrent/PriorityBlockingQueue.html), which clearly explains class functionality, usage, and method-level behavior in a clean, readable format. This inspired me to adopt consistent formatting, detailed descriptions, and clarity in my own Javadocs.
