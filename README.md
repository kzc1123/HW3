## 📌 Professional Javadoc Inspiration

I modeled my Javadoc formatting after the official Java documentation for [`PriorityBlockingQueue`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/concurrent/PriorityBlockingQueue.html), which clearly explains class functionality, usage, and method-level behavior in a clean, readable format. This inspired me to adopt consistent formatting, detailed descriptions, and clarity in my own Javadocs.
