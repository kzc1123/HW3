# HW3 - Automated Testing & Javadoc Documentation

## Assigned Test Cases

This repository includes the five automated test cases assigned to me from my teamâ€™s TP2 submission. Each test has been implemented in a standalone mainline format and is designed to validate specific functionalities using consistent validation logic.

## Professional Javadoc Inspiration

I modeled my Javadoc formatting after the official Java documentation for 
PriorityBlockingQueue (https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/concurrent/PriorityBlockingQueue.html), which clearly explains class functionality, usage, and method-level behavior in a clean, readable format. This inspired me to adopt consistent formatting, detailed descriptions, and clarity in my own Javadocs.
